## Rodrigo

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
dim(country_code)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
dim(globocan_incidence)
```

```{r}
merged_df <- merge(globocan_incidence, country_code, by = "country_code", all.x = TRUE)
```
